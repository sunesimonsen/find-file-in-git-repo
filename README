This provides a simple way to find any file in the git repo you are
currently working in using ido-mode.  To use this you have to have git
installed and when you run 'find-file-in-git-repo', default-directory
must be either a git repo or a directory nested in the git repo.

This is a Fork of [https://github.com/re5et/find-file-in-git-repo](https://github.com/re5et/find-file-in-git-repo)
with some new extensions for finding alternative files in git
repositories.
